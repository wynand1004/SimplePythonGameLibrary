# SGE (Version 0.3)
A simple Python game engine used for creating simple 2D games.  It is built on the Python Turtle module and is compatible with Python 2.x and 3.x.

**IT IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS

## Overview:

The purpose of the Simple Game Engine is to give beginning Python coders a simple framework to make basic 2D games.  It is intended as a simple alternative to Pygame. As it is built on the Turtle module, it has the same features and limitations of that module. It does not require any external libraries to be added.

## Getting Started
Download the repository to your computer.  There are 2 demo files, SGE_Demo.py which is a simple game using primitives (triangles and circles).  Use the left arrow, right arrow, and up arrow to control the player.  The other demo, SGE_Minimal_Example.py contains a simple game framework which will create a window - use this as the basis of your own programs.

## Known Issues

Image files need to be in .gif format.  This is a limitation of the turtle module.

Sound files should be in .wav format for widest compatibility.

On Windows, SGE uses the winsound module to play sounds.  I have not tested this yet as I do not have access to Windows at the moment.
